\title{Compute consecutive run lengths for flatline detection}
\usage{
utilASRflagrleflat(vals, delta)
}
\arguments{
\item{vals}{numeric vector of observed values.}

\item{delta}{non-negative numeric scalar.  Two adjacent observations are
considered part of the same flat run if their absolute difference is
less than or equal to \code{delta}.}
}
\value{
Integer vector the same length as \code{vals} giving the run length
at each position.
}
\description{
Compute consecutive run lengths for flatline detection
}
\details{
For each position \eqn{i}, the run length is the number of
consecutive observations ending at \eqn{i} (including \eqn{i} itself)
for which each successive absolute difference is \eqn{\le} \code{delta}.
A run length of 1 means the observation is not part of a flat stretch.
\code{NA} values in \code{vals} break the run.
}
\examples{
vals <- c(10, 10, 10.005, 10.003, 12, 12, 12)
utilASRflagrleflat(vals, delta = 0.01)
}
